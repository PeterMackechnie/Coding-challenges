    "3 card monte (or find the lady) is a game where the player is first presented with 3 playing cards face up (one of them a queen). The cards are then turned face down before being swiftly rearranged before the player whose objective is to keep track of which card is the queen. Once the 'rearrangement' is completed, the player is prompted to guess which card they think is the queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the code for a variation of the game described above. However, it differs in that there is no visual rearrangement of the cards for the player to observe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The player has the option of playing with more than 3 cards if they so wish."
